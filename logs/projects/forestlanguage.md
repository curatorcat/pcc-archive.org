Forest Language: The Inevitable Merge of Natural and Classical Computing is a 125 page informative writing to help the everyday person understand current technology, and what is to come. The paper addresses applications in nature, applications in technology, overlapping/bridging applications, and finally future applications. I also touch on TOE's which can help explain future applications/other questions. 

This writing took over two years to complete. 

I plan to write a second paper building off of this one in the future. I will hopefully have a couple other people to bounce ideas off of, which may make the impact, quality, and speed of writing the paper higher than this one.

If you are reading this and want to talk about stuff in the paper, feel free to reach out!
